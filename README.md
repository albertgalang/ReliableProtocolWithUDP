# ReliableProtocolWithUDP
To run the program please run server.py in one instance then client.py in another at
the same time. Type the file name that you want to be transfered into client.py and
the program will transfer the data over UDP reliably using TCP! We used test.txt to
send the data to check functionality and received.txt to output the data from the server.
